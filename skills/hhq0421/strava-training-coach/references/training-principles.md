# Training Principles for Injury-Free Running

## The 80/20 Rule

**80% of runs should be easy, 20% hard.**

Most runners run their easy days too hard and their hard days too easy. This leads to:
- Chronic fatigue
- Plateaued fitness
- Increased injury risk

**Easy run test:** You should be able to hold a conversation. If you can't speak in full sentences, slow down.

## The 10% Weekly Rule

**Never increase weekly mileage by more than 10%.**

Your body adapts to stress gradually. Sudden spikes in volume override your body's ability to recover.

- Week 1: 20 miles
- Week 2: 22 miles (+10%)
- Week 3: 24 miles (+9%)
- Week 4: 20 miles (cutback week)

## Warning Signs of Overtraining

### Yellow Flags (monitor closely)
- Elevated resting heart rate (+5-10 bpm)
- Persistent muscle soreness >48 hours
- Irritability or mood changes
- Sleep disturbances

### Red Flags (stop training, rest)
- Sharp pain that changes your gait
- Pain that worsens during run
- Extreme fatigue despite rest
- Illness that won't resolve

## The Stress + Rest = Growth Formula

Training creates stress. Rest allows adaptation. Without adequate recovery, you're just accumulating stress.

**Signs of adequate recovery:**
- Resting HR back to baseline
- Enthusiasm for next workout
- Good sleep quality
- Stable or improving performance

## Easy Day Heart Rate Guidelines

Your easy pace depends on fitness, but heart rate is universal:

- **Zone 2 (Easy):** 60-70% max HR
- **Zone 3 (Moderate):** 70-80% max HR  
- **Zone 4 (Hard):** 80-90% max HR

**Estimate max HR:** 220 - age (rough guide)

**Example (age 30):**
- Max HR ≈ 190
- Easy ceiling ≈ 133-152 bpm
- Most easy runs should feel comfortable at 140-145 bpm

## The Importance of Cutback Weeks

Every 3-4 weeks, reduce volume by 20-30% for a recovery week.

**Why:**
- Allows cumulative fatigue to dissipate
- Prevents overtraining
- Sets you up for next training block

**Pattern:**
- Build, build, build, recover
- 3 weeks up, 1 week down

## Consistency Over Intensity

**Better to run 30 minutes easy every day than one brutal 2-hour run per week.**

The benefits of running are cumulative and frequency-dependent:
- Mitochondrial density
- Capillary development
- Tendon/ligament strength

Missing 2-3 days in a row starts to undo adaptations.

## Prehab Over Rehab

**Do these before you get injured:**

- **Hip/glute strengthening:** Clamshells, lateral walks
- **Calf raises:** Daily, 2-3 sets of 15
- **Foot intrinsic work:** Towel scrunches, barefoot walking
- **Mobility:** Ankle circles, hip openers

10 minutes of prehab saves months of rehab.

## When to Skip a Run

**Don't run if:**
- You have a fever
- Pain is sharp and localized
- Pain changes your running form
- You're severely sleep-deprived (<4 hours)

**Do run easy if:**
- Mild muscle soreness
- General fatigue
- Low motivation (often helps!)

## The Long Run Rule

Your weekly long run should be:
- **25-30% of weekly volume** (max)
- **90+ minutes** for aerobic adaptations
- **Easy conversational pace** (not a race)

If your long run is >30% of weekly miles, you're not running enough during the week.

## Recovery Tools Ranked

**Most effective:**
1. Sleep (8+ hours)
2. Nutrition (protein + carbs post-run)
3. Easy days actually easy
4. Hydration

**Moderately effective:**
5. Foam rolling
6. Compression gear
7. Ice baths (post-hard sessions)

**Placebo/ritual:**
8. Fancy recovery drinks
9. Most supplements
10. Cryotherapy

## Race Taper Guidelines

**Final 2 weeks before race:**
- Week -2: 80% of peak volume
- Week -1: 50-60% of peak volume
- Final 3 days: Easy runs, short strides

**Trust the taper.** You won't lose fitness. You'll gain freshness.

## Mental Training

**Race day is won in training.**

- Train your gut with race nutrition
- Practice mental mantras during hard workouts
- Visualize success on easy days
- Build confidence through consistent training
