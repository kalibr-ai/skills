# act: `commitment`

A commissive speech act — a promise or pledge to act. The speaker binds themselves to a future course of action. Commitments create obligations and are tracked with `status` (open, fulfilled, withdrawn, etc.).

Example: "I'll fix auth by Friday", "I will review the PR tomorrow".
