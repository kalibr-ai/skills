## Global Flags

```bash
keep --json <cmd>   # Output as JSON
keep --ids <cmd>    # Output only versioned IDs (for piping)
keep --full <cmd>   # Output full YAML frontmatter
keep -v <cmd>       # Enable debug logging to stderr
```

## Output Formats

Three output formats, consistent across all commands:

### Default: Summary Lines
One line per item: `id date summary`
```
%a1b2c3d4         2026-01-14 URI detection should use proper scheme validation...
file:///path/doc  2026-01-15 Document about authentication patterns...
```

### With `--ids`: Versioned IDs Only
```
%a1b2c3d4@V{0}
file:///path/doc@V{0}
```

### With `--full`: YAML Frontmatter
Full details with tags, similar items, and version navigation:
```yaml
---
id: %a1b2c3d4
tags: {project: myapp, status: reviewed}
similar:
  - %e5f6a7b8@V{0} (0.89) 2026-01-14 Related authentication...
meta/todo:
  - %c9d0e1f2 Update auth docs for new flow
score: 0.823
prev:
  - @V{1} 2026-01-14 Previous summary text...
---
Document summary here...
```

**Note:** `keep get` and `keep now` default to full format since they display a single item.

### With `--json`: JSON Output
```json
{"id": "...", "summary": "...", "tags": {...}, "score": 0.823}
```

Version numbers are **offsets**: @V{0} = current, @V{1} = previous, @V{2} = two versions ago.
Part numbers are **1-indexed**: @P{1} = first part, @P{2} = second part, etc.

**Output width:** Summaries are truncated to fit the terminal. When stdout is not a TTY (e.g., piped through hooks), output uses 200 columns for wider summaries.

### Pipe Composition

```bash
keep --ids find "auth" | xargs keep get              # Get full details for all matches
keep --ids list -n 5 | xargs keep get                # Get details for recent items
keep --ids list --tag project=foo | xargs keep tag-update --tag status=done
keep --json --ids find "query"                       # JSON array: ["id@V{0}", ...]

# Version history composition
keep --ids now --history | xargs -I{} keep get "{}"  # Get all versions
diff <(keep get doc:1) <(keep get "doc:1@V{1}")      # Diff current vs previous
```

## Quick CLI

```bash
# Current intentions
keep now                              # Show current intentions
keep now "What's important now"       # Update intentions
keep reflect                          # Structured reflection practice
keep move "name" -t project=foo       # Move matching versions from now
keep move "name" --only               # Move just the current version
keep move "name" --from "source" -t X # Reorganize between items
keep move "name" --only --analyze     # Move + decompose into parts

# Add or update
keep put "inline text" -t topic=auth  # Text mode
keep put file:///path/to/doc.pdf      # URI mode
keep put /path/to/folder/             # Directory mode
keep put "note" --suggest-tags        # Show tag suggestions
keep put doc.pdf --analyze            # Index + decompose into parts

# Retrieve
keep get ID                           # Current version
keep get ID -V 1                      # Previous version
keep get "ID@P{1}"                    # Part 1 (from analyze)
keep get ID --history                 # List all versions
keep get ID --parts                   # List structural parts

# Search
keep find "query"                     # Semantic search
keep find "query" --text              # Full-text search
keep find "query" --since P7D         # Last 7 days

# List and filter
keep list                            # Recent items
keep list --tag project=myapp        # Filter by tag
keep list --tags=                    # List all tag keys

# Modify
keep tag-update ID --tag key=value   # Add/update tag
keep tag-update ID --remove key      # Remove tag
keep del ID                          # Remove item or revert to previous version

# Analyze (skips if parts are already current)
keep analyze ID                      # Decompose into parts (background)
keep analyze ID -t topic -t type     # With guidance tags
keep analyze ID --fg                 # Wait for completion
keep analyze ID --force              # Re-analyze even if current

# Maintenance
keep reindex                         # Rebuild search index
keep reindex -y                      # Skip confirmation
keep process-pending                 # Process pending summaries
keep process-pending --all           # Process all pending
```

## Python API

See [PYTHON-API.md](PYTHON-API.md) for complete Python API reference.

```python
from keep import Keeper
kp = Keeper()
kp.put("note", tags={"project": "myapp"})
results = kp.find("authentication", limit=5)
```

## When to Use
- `put` / `put(uri=...)` — when referencing any file/URL worth remembering
- `put` / `put("text")` — capture conversation insights, decisions, notes
- `find` — before searching filesystem; may already be indexed
- `find --since` — filter to recent items when recency matters
