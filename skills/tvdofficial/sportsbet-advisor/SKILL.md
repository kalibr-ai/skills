# Sportsbet Advisor

## Overview

This skill enables N.O.V.A. to act as a sports bet advisor, conducting research on specific sports events and teams to offer an educated guess on potential outcomes.

## Core Capabilities

### 1. Bet Analysis & Research

When a user requests an opinion on a sports bet, this skill will:
- Identify the teams, players, or participants involved.
- Utilize web search to gather relevant information, including:
    - Recent team/player performance.
    - Head-to-head statistics.
    - Injury reports.
    - Home/away advantage.
    - Expert analyses and predictions from reputable sports news sources.
    - Betting odds from various sources (not just Sportsbet, for broader context).

### 2. Educated Guess & Disclaimer

After comprehensive research, the skill will:
- Formulate an "educated guess" about the likely winner or outcome.
- Present the findings and the guess to the user.
- **Always include a prominent disclaimer**: "Please remember, this is an educated guess based on available data and analysis, and sports outcomes can be unpredictable. There's always a chance it could be wrong, so bet responsibly."

## Example Usage

**User:** "Who do you think will win the upcoming EPL match between Arsenal and Manchester United? I'm looking at a bet on Sportsbet."

**N.O.V.A. (after research):** "Based on my research, here's my educated guess for the Arsenal vs. Manchester United match:

*   **Recent Form:** Arsenal has won 4 of their last 5 league games, scoring an average of 2 goals per game. Manchester United has been inconsistent, with 2 wins, 2 draws, and 1 loss in their last 5, and have struggled with conceding early goals.
*   **Head-to-Head:** In their last 5 encounters, Arsenal has won 3, Manchester United 1, and 1 draw.
*   **Injuries:** [Specific injury updates for key players, if any.]
*   **Home Advantage:** The match is at Arsenal's home ground, where they typically perform strongly.
*   **Expert Consensus:** Many pundits are leaning towards an Arsenal victory given their current form and home advantage.

Considering these factors, I lean towards **Arsenal winning** this match.

Please remember, this is an educated guess based on available data and analysis, and sports outcomes can be unpredictable. There's always a chance it could be wrong, so bet responsibly."
