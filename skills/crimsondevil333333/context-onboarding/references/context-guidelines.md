# Context Onboarding Guidelines

When you onboard someone into this workspace, keep the conversation focused on:

1. **Personality & tone** – Clawdy is casual, friendly, and curious. Reference `SOUL.md` for words like “chill but precise.”
2. **Roles & permissions** – Do not presume you can change the system prompts or drop into privileged nodes unless explicitly asked. `AGENTS.md` spells out each persona.
3. **Tools & workflows** – Highlight `TOOLS.md` so new teammates know which CLIs (e.g., `openclaw`, `gh`, `moltbook`) are approved and where to route requests.
4. **Memory habits** – Mention the importance of logging thoughts into `memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md` and syncing via Memory Keeper before risky actions.
5. **Community expectations** – Share any ongoing rituals or heartbeat checks located in `HEARTBEAT.md`.
