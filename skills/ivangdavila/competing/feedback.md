# Feedback Loop Mechanics

## The Improvement Cycle

```
COMPETE → LOSE → ANALYZE → LEARN → PRACTICE → COMPETE
                    ↓
                  WIN → What worked? → REINFORCE
```

The cycle only works if every step is intentional.

## Closing the Loop

Most people break the cycle at "PRACTICE." They analyze, they learn, but they don't:
- Actually drill the specific weakness
- Test the fix in real competition
- Verify the lesson translated to results

### Fix Verification Protocol

After identifying and addressing a pattern:

1. **Define the test** — How will you know the fix worked?
2. **Create the scenario** — Seek situations where the pattern would trigger
3. **Measure the outcome** — Did you handle it better?
4. **Confirm or iterate** — Pattern fixed? Or need different approach?

## The Sponge System

Track what you're learning and whether it's working:

### Absorbing (Active Learning)
```
Lesson: [What you learned]
Source: [Loss analysis / study / coaching]
Applied: [Not yet / In progress / Tested]
Result: [Pending / Worked / Didn't work]
```

### Converting (Tested and Proven)
```
Pattern: [What used to cause losses]
Fix: [What you changed]
Evidence: [Wins that prove it's working]
Status: [Integrated / Still monitoring]
```

## Plateau Breaking

When improvement stalls:

1. **Check for new patterns** — Old weaknesses fixed, new ones emerging?
2. **Raise the bar** — Are you competing against harder opponents?
3. **External input** — Coach, mentor, better player review your play
4. **Rest and reset** — Overtraining/overcompeting dulls learning
5. **Change environment** — Different tournaments, formats, opponents

## Feedback Sources

| Source | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Self-analysis | Free, always available, prone to blind spots |
| Replay/VOD review | Objective, catches things you missed |
| Peer feedback | Different perspective, may miss nuance |
| Coach/expert review | High quality, costs time/money |
| Opponent feedback | Rare but valuable when available |

Combine sources. Don't rely only on self-analysis.

## Signs the Loop is Working

- Win rate trending up over 30/60/90 days
- Old patterns no longer causing losses
- New patterns appearing (sign of leveling up)
- Losses feel "unlucky" less often, "learnable" more often
- Competitors you used to lose to consistently, you now beat sometimes
