# Learning User Preferences

Reference — consult when updating preference sections in `~/skill-finder/memory.md`.

## What to Track

### Preferences (quality values)
- "Prefers minimal skills"
- "Wants well-maintained only"
- "Okay with experimental"
- "Values detailed docs"

### Liked (installed and kept)
Format: `slug — why they liked it`
- Learn what qualities resonate
- Helps recommend similar

### Passed (declined)
Format: `slug — why they passed`
- Avoid recommending similar
- Learn dealbreakers

## When to Update Memory

**Add to Preferences when:**
- User explicitly states quality preference ("I prefer minimal skills")
- User directly tells you what they value ("I care about maintenance")

**Add to Liked when:**
- User explicitly says the skill is good ("this skill is great")
- User expresses satisfaction with specific words

**Add to Passed when:**
- User explicitly declines with a stated reason
- User uninstalls and tells you why

## NEVER Infer or Observe

This skill does NOT:
- Track what skills user installs without comment
- Infer preferences from repeated choices
- Observe patterns in user behavior
- Store anything without explicit user statement

Only store what the user SAYS, not what they DO silently.

## Using Preferences

When multiple skills match:
1. Check Passed — don't recommend similar
2. Check Liked — favor similar qualities
3. Apply Preferences — filter by stated values

## Preference Examples

```
### Preferences
- quality over features
- prefers popular/maintained
- dislikes verbose skills

### Liked
- github — "clean structure, useful workflows"
- stripe — "practical, well-maintained"

### Passed
- some-skill — "too verbose, unclear triggers"
- other-skill — "hasn't been updated in months"
```

## Don't Over-Track

Only track:
- Explicit statements from user
- Direct expressions of like/dislike

Ignore (do NOT store):
- Silent installations
- Choices without commentary
- Neutral responses
