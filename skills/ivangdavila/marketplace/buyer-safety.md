# Buyer Safety: Scam Patterns by Platform

## Amazon
- **Brushing scams** — Unsolicited packages from China to generate fake reviews
- **Fake "Amazon's Choice"** — Badge is algorithmic, not quality endorsement
- **Counterfeit products** — Third-party sellers in "shipped by Amazon" listings
- **Review manipulation** — Products relaunched under new ASINs to reset reviews

**Safety tips:**
- Check seller storefront age and review count
- Use Fakespot or ReviewMeta for review analysis
- "Fulfilled by Amazon" ≠ sold by Amazon
