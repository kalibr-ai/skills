# OpenClaw Vault

Protects your credential lifecycle — not just finding secrets in source code (that's what Sentry does), but tracking how credentials are exposed through services, permissions, history, configs, containers, and time.

## Why This Matters

Credentials don't just leak through source code. They leak through:
- **Permissions** — .env files readable by every user on the system
- **Shell history** — passwords and tokens visible in `.bash_history`
- **Git config** — credentials embedded in remote URLs
- **Config files** — hardcoded secrets in JSON/YAML/TOML/INI configs
- **Log files** — tokens accidentally logged during debugging
- **Docker configs** — secrets baked into container images
- **Staleness** — credentials that haven't been rotated in months

This skill watches the full credential lifecycle. Sentry finds secrets in files. Vault finds secrets that are *exposed*.

**Need automated remediation?** Upgrade to [openclaw-vault-pro](https://github.com/AtlasPA/openclaw-vault-pro) for auto-fix permissions, credential rotation reminders, access control policies, and secure credential injection.

## Commands

### Full Credential Audit

Comprehensive credential exposure audit: permission checks, shell history, git config, config file scanning, log file scanning, gitignore coverage, and staleness detection.

```bash
python3 {baseDir}/scripts/vault.py audit --workspace /path/to/workspace
```

### Exposure Check

Detect credential exposure vectors: misconfigured permissions, public directory exposure, git history risks, Docker credential embedding, shell alias leaks, and URL query parameter credentials in code.

```bash
python3 {baseDir}/scripts/vault.py exposure --workspace /path/to/workspace
```

### Credential Inventory

Build a structured inventory of all credential files in the workspace. Categorizes by type (API key, database URI, token, certificate, SSH key, password), tracks age, and flags stale or exposed credentials.

```bash
python3 {baseDir}/scripts/vault.py inventory --workspace /path/to/workspace
```

### Quick Status

One-line summary: credential count, exposure count, staleness warnings.

```bash
python3 {baseDir}/scripts/vault.py status --workspace /path/to/workspace
```

## Workspace Auto-Detection

If `--workspace` is omitted, the script tries:
1. `OPENCLAW_WORKSPACE` environment variable
2. Current directory (if AGENTS.md exists)
3. `~/.openclaw/workspace` (default)

## What It Checks

| Category | Details |
|----------|---------|
| **Permissions** | .env files with world-readable or group-readable permissions |
| **Shell History** | Credentials in .bash_history, .zsh_history, .python_history, etc. |
| **Git Config** | Credentials embedded in git remote URLs, plaintext credential helpers |
| **Config Files** | Hardcoded secrets in JSON, YAML, TOML, INI config files |
| **Log Files** | Credentials accidentally logged in .log files |
| **Gitignore** | Missing patterns for .env, *.pem, *.key, credentials.json, etc. |
| **Staleness** | Credential files older than 90 days that may need rotation |
| **Public Dirs** | Credential files in public/, static/, www/, dist/, build/ |
| **Git History** | Credential files in git repos that may be committed |
| **Docker** | Secrets hardcoded in Dockerfile and docker-compose configs |
| **Shell RC** | Credentials in .bashrc, .zshrc, .profile aliases |
| **URL Params** | API keys/tokens passed in URL query strings in code |

## Exit Codes

- `0` — Clean, no issues
- `1` — Warnings detected (review needed)
- `2` — Critical exposure detected (action needed)

## No External Dependencies

Python standard library only. No pip install. No network calls. Everything runs locally.

## Cross-Platform

Works with OpenClaw, Claude Code, Cursor, and any tool using the Agent Skills specification.
